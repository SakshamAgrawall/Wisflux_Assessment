# Typescript Quiz (level 1)
## Theory :

Q1. What are the basic data types in TypeScript?

ans. Basic data types in Typescript are number , string , boolean etc

Q2. What is Generic data type.

ans. Generic types allow us to write a general class that works with different types, allowing code to re-use.

Q3. What is type inferring in TS.

ans. The TypeScript compiler infers the type information when there is no explicit information available in the form of type annotations.<br> In TypeScript, TypeScript compiler infers the type information when: Variables and members are initialized. Setting default values for parameters.<br> Determined function return types.

Q4. What are the possible ways to define typing for functions.

ans. There are multiple ways to define types for functions:

* giving type in parameter.
* giving type inside the function.
* making a interface.


Q5. How to define Generic type for Classes.

ans. To use generics, you need to use angular brackets and then specify a type variable inside them. Developers generally use T , X and Y .<br> But it can be anything depending upon your preference. You can then assign the same variable name as the type to the parameter of the function
